# Command-Line Chess
The classic game of chess written on the command line using Ruby

## Done
- Basic piece movement
- Pieces have `possible_moves` method which calculate all possible moves
- Board interface (from `chess.rb` which is the first iteration of the project)
- Game controller that processes the inputs and moves on the board
- Method that gets all legal moves a player can make

## In Progress
- `chess2_spec.rb` to test pieces, and the many many scenarios that chess can/will throw at it

## To-Do
- Stalemate
- Support castling
- Performance optimization if I want to try to use it for computer eval or something
